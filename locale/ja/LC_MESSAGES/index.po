"CoFEA is an initiative that aims to popularise application of open-source "
"simulation software in solving real engineering problems. Even though CoFEA "
"itself sounds like the magic drink which drives engineering minds, it is a "
"combination of the words *cooperation* and *Finite Element Analysis*. The "
"aim of the project is to create an environment where engineers could "
"exchange theirs experience and knowledge of open-source simulation codes so "
"that others could use them with joy and confidence. The following steps will"
" be undertaken to achieve this goal:"
